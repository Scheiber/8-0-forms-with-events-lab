  <h3>Some people dream of success.<br /> While you're gonna wake up and work hard at it.<br />
    Nothing is impossible.<br />
    You should get to the point where anyone else would quit,<br /> and you're not going to stop there.
    No, what are you waiting for?<br />
    Do it. Just do it. Yes you can. Just do it.<br />
    If you're tired of starting over,
    stop giving up.</h3>
